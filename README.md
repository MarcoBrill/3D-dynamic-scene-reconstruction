# 3D Dynamic Scene Reconstruction

This repository contains a Python implementation for 3D dynamic scene reconstruction and synthesis using modern computer vision techniques. The pipeline combines reconstructive methods (e.g., structure-from-motion, neural radiance fields) and generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) to reconstruct and synthesize dynamic 3D scenes.

## Features
- **3D Reconstruction**: Reconstruct dynamic scenes from multi-view video inputs.
- **Scene Synthesis**: Generate new 3D scenes using generative models.
- **Combined Pipeline**: Integrate reconstructive and generative methods for enhanced scene understanding.

## Inputs
Multi-view video sequences (e.g., data/video_1.mp4, data/video_2.mp4)
Camera calibration parameters (e.g., intrinsic and extrinsic matrices)

## Outputs
Reconstructed 3D scene (e.g., point cloud, mesh)
Synthesized 3D scene (e.g., generated mesh or point cloud)
Visualizations (e.g., rendered images, 3D plots)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- PyTorch3D
- Open3D
- NumPy
- OpenCV

Install dependencies using:
```bash
